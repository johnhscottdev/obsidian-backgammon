# Description of the feature
  1. Main goal: I this program to allow parsing and display optional analysis text that may be included in addition to the XGID. Examples are later in this file. 
  2. User experience: For the first pass, we will just display the analysis below the board. When you are ready, ask me for a screenshot example of the analysis so we can match the format from the program "eXtremeGammon"
  3. Technical scope: It will require new parsing code to parse the analysis. This should be in a separate file from the parse XGID to make the code manageable. It will also require new rendering code separate from the renderBoard code
  4. Dependencies: Hopefully nothing new here. 
  5. Complexity indicators: The UI will optionally change if the analysis is present or not. The parsing will also change if the analysis is there or not. 
  6. Important parts of the analysis. There are two types of analysis that will look different. 
  6.1 - Move Analysis: This describes potential moves given the dice roll. This helps a player understand which moves are best. For each move the following data is to be parsed. 
    Move - this in Backgammon Notation examples are  "Bar/20 13/11" or "14/9*" or "6/4(3) 13/11"
    Equity - The first number is the equity change of the move and the second number is the equity difference from the optimal move
    Player Wins (this is player on roll), Gammons, Backgammons - Displays probability of winning, gammons, and backgammons
    Opponent Wins (this player not on roll), Gammons, Backgammons
    Analysis level - like "Book" or "4-ply" or "XG Roller++"
  6.2 - Cube Analysis: This describes the potential cube action. This happens for positions where a player has not yet rolled (00)
    Winning chances for bother playres like in the move analysis
    Cube Equities - breakdown for each possible action
    Best action for the players
