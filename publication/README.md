# Backgammon XGID Display

Transform your backgammon analysis in Obsidian with beautiful visual position rendering and comprehensive move analysis.

## What is this plugin?

This plugin lets you display backgammon positions directly in your Obsidian notes using the XGID format. Simply paste an XGID string in a code block, and get a fully rendered backgammon board with analysis.

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go to Community plugins
3. Search for "Backgammon XGID Display"
4. Install and enable the plugin

### Basic Usage

Create a code block with `xgid` as the language:

````
```xgid
XGID=-a-bE-D---cD---c-b-a-E-:0:0:1:63:0:0:0:0
```
````

This renders the standard backgammon opening position with X to play 6-3.

## XGID Format Basics

XGID strings encode complete backgammon positions. The format is:

```
XGID=position:cube:turn:dice:scores:rules:match_length
```

### Key Components

- **Position**: 26-character string encoding checker positions
- **Cube**: Doubling cube value and owner
- **Turn**: Which player's turn (-1 for O, other for X)
- **Dice**: Current dice roll
- **Scores**: Match scores
- **Rules**: Game rules (Crawford, Jacoby, etc.)
- **Match**: Match length (0 for money game)

### Common Examples

| Situation | XGID |
|-----------|------|
| Opening position | `XGID=-a-bE-D---cD---c-b-a-E-:0:0:1:63:0:0:0:0` |
| Match play | `XGID=--b-C-E----bB-Bb-c----A--:2:1:0:63:2:1:0:7` |
| Money game | `XGID=----BD-------d-b-a-E---:3:2:-1:42:0:0:0:0` |

## Troubleshooting

### Board not showing?

- Make sure you're using `xgid` as the code block language
- Check that your XGID string is properly formatted
- Ensure the position string is exactly 26 characters

### Analysis not displaying?

- Analysis must be in the same code block as the XGID
- Leave an empty line between the XGID and analysis
- Check that the analysis format matches eXtreme Gammon output

### Position looks wrong?

- Verify your XGID string is correct
- Check the turn field (-1 for O player, other for X)
- Ensure cube ownership is right (0=center, 1=X, 2=O)

## Getting XGIDs

You can get XGID strings from:

- **Simple XGID** - "File -> Copy XGID to Clipboard" from the menu or with the hotkey CTRL+SHIFT+C
- **XGID with Analysis** - "File -> Copy position to Clipboard" from the menu or with the hotkey CTRL+SHIFT+C
